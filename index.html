          libcbc is an ongoing project to explore the possible APIs and
          abstractions for a versatile, usable, and extensible cryptographic library.
          The main focus is on functional encryption primitives to support robust
          confidentiality and privacy in a data- and content-centric world. It is also
          intended to support signature schemes and symmetric-key primitives.

        </h3>

        <p>
            According to [1], functional encryption "supports restricted secret keys that enable a key holder
            to learn a specific function of encrypted data, but learn nothing else about the data." This is a
            significant deviation from the standard view of encryption, wherein the goal was (a) to send a specific
            message to some party holding the appropriate decryption secret and (b) access to the decrypted
            data was <em>all or nothing</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Technically, given some <em>functionality</em> $$F(\cdot,\cdot)$$, modeled
            as a Turing Machine, an authority in possession of a master secret key can
            generate a ecret key $$sk_k$$ which allows the holder to compute $$F(sk_k, \cdot)$$
            on encrypted data. In other words, functional encryption enables the
            holder of $$sk_k$$ to compute $$F(sk_k, x)$$ given some encrypted form of $$x$$ [1].
        </p>

        <p>
            This definition is quite flexible and does not place any restrictions on
            the functionalities. One could, for example, implement access control
            backed by this primitive. This could be done by specifying $$x$$ as
            a tuple consisting of an authorized user's identity (or any other
            complicated access control structure) and an encrypted message. The
            identity is typically called an index, and it is usually public.
            The functionality could then check that the secret key $$sk_k$$ is associated
            with an authorized user in the tuple and, if so, decrypt the message.
        </p>

        <p>
            There are many existing instances of functional encryption, including:
            <ul>
                <li>Standard public-key encryption</li>
                <li>Predicate encryption [2,3]</li>
                <li>Predicate encryption with a public index</li>
                <li>Identity-based encryption (IBE) [4,5]</li>
                <li>Attribute-based encryption (ABE) [6]</li>
                <li>Key-Policy ABE [7]</li>
                <li>Ciphertext-Policy ABE [8]</li>
                <li>Anonymous Identity-Based Encryption [9]</li>
                <li>Hidden Vector Encryption [2]</li>
                <li>Inner Product Encryption [10]</li>
            </ul>
            Additional information about these specific instances, as well as more
            references to relevant papers, can be found in [1].
        </p>

        <p>
            Mathematically, functional encryption has the following syntax:
        </p>

        <p>
            $$(pp, msk) \leftarrow setup(1^{\lambda})$$
            $$sk_k \leftarrow keygen(msk, k)$$
            $$c \leftarrow enc(pp, x)$$
            $$y \leftarrow dec(sk, c)$$
        </p>

        <p>
            where $$pp$$ are the public parameters, $$msk$$ is a master secret key,
            $$sk_k$$ is a secret key for user $$k$$, $$x$$ and $$c$$ are the plaintext
            message and its encrypted form, and $$y$$ is the output of the
            functionality $$F(sk_k, x)$$ computed.
        </p>

        <p>
            The goal of libcbc is to provide a generic and usable API for functional
            encryption primitives that provides as much isolation to the application.
